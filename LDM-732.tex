\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}


\subsection{Scope}\label{sec:scope}

\begin{center}

\end{center}

This document pertains only to the verification of the network infrastructure, not the applications and services that use the network, specifically, up to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model}{OSI Layer} 3 for the Summit facility, the Base Facility, Summit to Base communication, Base to Archive communication, and Archive to the [Chilean] Data Access Center communication.
The transfer of data products, such as alert streams or pixel data, from the US Data Facility to parties external to the observatory are explicitly out of scope.

As such, all of the Verification Elements defined in the \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/projects/LVV/}{LSST Verification and Validation (LVV)} Jira project and presented in this document are Lower Level (LL) in the System Engineering test hierarchy.

LL corresponds to Data Management Subsystem Integration.
Where appropriate, additional comments regarding Same Level (SL) which corresponds to LSST System Integration, and Higher Level (HL) which corresponds to LSST Commissioning, are called out in the Verification Elements.

Note that significant testing of the networks occurs prior to subsystem and system integration, i.e.\  prior to verification, as discussed in \href{https://ls.st/document-14789}{LSST LHN End-to-End Plan} and associated documentation in \href{https://docushare.lsstcorp.org/docushare/dsweb/View/Collection-3758}{Collection-3758}.

\subsection{Specification Flow-down}\label{sec:sepcflowd}

\subsubsection{Data Management Subsystem Requirements Flow-down}\label{sec:dmreqflowd}

The Data Management Subsystem Requirements (DMSR) (\citeds{LSE-61}) drive the LSST Observatory Network Design.
The specific DMSR requirements that directly drive network design are listed here for convenience.

\subsubsection{Observatory System Specifications Flow-down}\label{sec:ossflowd}

Note that the Observatory System Specifications (OSS) (\citeds{LSE-30}) also include general requirements on security, disaster recovery, physical environment (including seismic activity), and shipping which are flowed down to the subsystems, and while they apply to all subsystems, including the networks, they will be tested and verified in the Telescope and Data Management Subsystem Integration Tests and in the LSST Commissioning Phase, as part of the LSST System Integration Test.
Those requirements are excluded from this specification and the associated verification matrix, as they will be addressed during system integration testing.

\subsection{LSST Verification and Validation (LVV) Jira project}\label{sec:lvv}

The \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/projects/LVV/}{LSST Verification and Validation (LVV)} Jira project lists the specifications within or derived from, and traceable to, the DMSR specifications, in Verification Elements that also specify the methods to be used to verify, the responsible parties, and additional notes regarding verification, per the \citeds{LSE-160} LSST Verification and Validation Process.
The Verification Elements then have one or more Test Cases associated with them that describe the implementation of the verification activities in terms of specific tests to be executed.
Those Test Cases are then scheduled via Test Plans and Campaigns, and executed with results reported in Test Cycles.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Schedule and Resources}\label{sec:schedule}

The schedule and resources required for network verification are defined in the LSST Project Management Control System (PMCS).
They are covered by the final integration test activities in the WBS elements 02C.08.03 Long-Haul Networks.
In each Verification Element, a cross-reference to the ID of the appropriate predecessor PMCS activities is provided in the pre-conditions field.
