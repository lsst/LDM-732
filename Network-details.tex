\title{Verification Elements Details for the Network Component in DM Subsystem}
\mkshorttitle


\section{Introduction}

This plan governs only tests of the network infrastructure, not the applications and services that use the network.  
To be specific, this plan governs tests of the network only up to ISO OSI Layer 3:  \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model}.

As such, all of the tests governed by this plan and defined in the Rubin Observatory Verification and Validation JIRA project are defined as Lower Level (LL).
LL corresponded to Data Management Subsystem Integration Test.  
Where appropriate, additional comments regarding Same Level (SL) which corresponds to Rubin Observatory Sytem Integration, 
and Higher Level (HL), which corresponds to Rubin Observatory Commissioning, are provided as comments in JIRA.

Note that significant testing of the networks occurs during subsystem and system integration, prior to verification, 
as documented in \citeds{document-14789} LSST LHN End-to-End Plan.

Finally, note that the Summit Network is not a DM deliverable and as such is not contained within this plan, 
except in terms of connections between these networks and the Summit Network.  
As a Telescope and Site Deliverable, the Summit Network is covered more fully in the Telescope and Site V\&V plans.


\subsection{Scope}
This is a detailed overview of the Verification Elements and relevant associated information,
the Network component in DM subsystem.
It is provided for convenience as a working document.
The information presented here is officially baselined in {\lsstDocType}-{\lsstDocNum} --
the Verification Elements baseline document -- available at
\url{https://\lsstDocType-\lsstDocNum.lsst.io}.
Test case information is baselined in the  {\testspec} test specification, available at
\url{https://\testspec.lsst.io}.
Official releases of both documents are also available in Docushare.
Please always use {\lsstDocType}-{\lsstDocNum} and {\testspec} official releases for reference.

This report is updated together with the the verification elements baseline document, {\lsstDocType}-{\lsstDocNum}.
Therefore, verification elements information will be always up-to-date.
Test cases information instead may be outdated, since test cases may be subject to changes during future phases
of the V\&V activities.
